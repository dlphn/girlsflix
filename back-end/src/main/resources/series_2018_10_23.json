The show was created by Dan Curtis. The story bible, which was written by Art Wallace, does not mention any supernatural elements. It was unprecedented in daytime television when ghosts were introduced about six months after it began.\n\nThe series became hugely popular when vampire Barnabas Collins appeared a year into its run. Dark Shadows also featured werewolves, zombies, man-made monsters, witches, warlocks, time travel, and a parallel universe. A small company of actors each played many roles; indeed, as actors came and went, some characters were played by more than one actor. Major writers besides Art Wallace included Malcolm Marmorstein, Sam Hall, Gordon Russell, and Violet Welles.\n\nDark Shadows was distinguished by its vividly melodramatic performances, atmospheric interiors, memorable storylines, numerous dramatic plot twists, unusually adventurous music score, and broad and epic cosmos of characters and heroic adventures. Now regarded as something of a classic, it continues to enjoy an intense cult following. Although the original series ran for only five years, its scheduling as a daily daytime drama allowed it to amass more single episodes during its run than most other science-fiction\/fantasy genre series produced for English-language television, including Doctor Who and the entire Star Trek television franchise. Only the paranormal soap opera Passions, with a total of 2,231 episodes, has more.","date":"1966-06-27","imageLink":"\/y2t6w8il225T2IRsvpWJ2SzTrSn.jpg","seasons":[{"air_date":null,"overview":"","episode_count":31,"name":"Specials","season_number":0,"id":9309,"poster_path":"\/xfg24vBGoQcn1wRYtzrnfDTbfIO.jpg"},{"air_date":"1966-06-27","overview":"","episode_count":124,"name":"Season 1","season_number":1,"id":9299,"poster_path":"\/hQoSif6Ah41U1wUH2moRKARttvU.jpg"},{"air_date":"1966-12-20","overview":"","episode_count":64,"name":"Season 2","season_number":2,"id":9300,"poster_path":"\/ha1IZZ0KN88kfM3xw3R3S2A6kLA.jpg"},{"air_date":"1967-03-21","overview":"","episode_count":83,"name":"Season 3","season_number":3,"id":9297,"poster_path":"\/cfdbgIT2EQMEnzUcRlAzOqHJ8fm.jpg"},{"air_date":"1967-07-17","overview":"","episode_count":90,"name":"Season 4","season_number":4,"id":9298,"poster_path":"\/p1opR9cAkcMQunGDRBVy6PF0Xdo.jpg"},{"air_date":"1967-11-20","overview":"","episode_count":93,"name":"Season 5","season_number":5,"id":9304,"poster_path":"\/uSviTZi2gEkYIYTHCSGQo953Mzs.jpg"},{"air_date":"1968-04-01","overview":"","episode_count":236,"name":"Season 6","season_number":6,"id":9308,"poster_path":"\/8diYOwkiAFYVZAqduhEhJH6ACeZ.jpg"},{"air_date":"1969-03-03","overview":"","episode_count":182,"name":"Season 7","season_number":7,"id":9303,"poster_path":"\/6EKnVty0bxFYB9RECxb0FjbHfJE.jpg"},{"air_date":"1969-11-14","overview":"","episode_count":92,"name":"Season 8","season_number":8,"id":9302,"poster_path":"\/iJmV8z6XYaGcZQKbgOihRMMig7y.jpg"},{"air_date":"1970-03-30","overview":"","episode_count":79,"name":"Season 9","season_number":9,"id":9305,"poster_path":"\/ev2owfQdhgvAGvczDKyZCNok3EI.jpg"},{"air_date":"1970-07-20","overview":"","episode_count":49,"name":"Season 10","season_number":10,"id":9307,"poster_path":"\/1trP8fqSaFwHoH0VRVTF1dBDRNz.jpg"},{"air_date":"1970-09-25","overview":"","episode_count":85,"name":"Season 11","season_number":11,"id":9301,"poster_path":"\/aRUqoIyLId52v5lV83L60XzT9CN.jpg"},{"air_date":"1971-01-28","overview":"","episode_count":46,"name":"Season 12","season_number":12,"id":9306,"poster_path":"\/zEGYF01qNhnSj9UgBFZuGbCTiAe.jpg"}],"rating":6.5,"serieType":[18,10765,10766],"id":2883,"title":"Dark Shadows"},{"summary":"An anthology horror drama series centering on different characters and locations, including a house with a murderous past, an asylum, a witch coven, a freak show, a hotel, a farmhouse in Roanoke and a cult.","date":"2011-10-05","imageLink":"\/zheiOgPKDMvYjrCSrMLv8FSNJn4.jpg","seasons":[{"air_date":"2011-10-05","overview":"When the Harmon family relocates to a stately mansion in Los Angeles, disturbing secrets start enveloping each of their lives.
